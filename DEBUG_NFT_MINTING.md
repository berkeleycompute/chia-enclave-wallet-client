# NFT Minting Debug Guide

## Issue
The NFT minting process was failing silently - files were uploading successfully, but the actual NFT minting was not completing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- ✅ Added proper error handling in `StreamlinedChiaNFTMintForm`
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging throughout the minting pipeline
- ✅ Fixed missing error display when minting fails

### 2. Added Debug Logging

#### In `useChiaNFTMint.ts`:
- 🔍 Config validation logging
- 🔑 Synthetic public key retrieval logging
- 📍 Wallet address retrieval logging  
- 🪙 Coin selection and balance logging
- 🚀 API request logging with sanitized data
- 📋 API response logging

#### In `ChiaCloudWalletClient.ts`:
- 🔑 Mnemonic vs synthetic key flow detection
- 🔧 Unsigned spend bundle creation logging
- 🖋️ Signing and broadcasting flow logging

#### In `ChiaNFTMintExample.tsx`:
- 🚀 Mint start logging with full config
- 📝 Result logging before success/error handling
- ❌ Explicit error throwing when mint fails

### 3. Created Debug Tool
- 🔧 New `NFTMintDebugger.tsx` component for step-by-step testing
- ✅ Wallet connection validation
- 🔍 Configuration validation testing
- 🪙 Coin availability checking
- 🧪 Isolated mint testing with detailed logging

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Use the Debug Component
1. Import and use `NFTMintDebugger` component
2. Connect your wallet
3. Run each test step individually:
   - Check Wallet Data
   - Validate Config  
   - Test Mint

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
With the enhanced logging, you should now see detailed output like:
```
🔍 Validating mint config: {...}
✅ Config validation passed
🔑 Getting synthetic public key...
✅ Got synthetic public key: a1b2c3d4e5...
📍 Getting wallet address...
✅ Got wallet address: xch1abc123...
🪙 Getting unspent coins...
✅ Got coins: 5 available
💰 Fee calculation: {feeAmount: 1000000, mintCost: 1, totalNeeded: 1000001}
✅ Selected coins: 2 total value: 50000000000
🖋️ Using synthetic public key flow for NFT minting
🚀 Executing mint with request: {...}
```

### Step 3: Common Issues to Check

#### 1. Wallet Connection Issues
- ❌ No synthetic public key → Wallet not properly connected
- ❌ No wallet address → Authentication failed

#### 2. Balance Issues  
- ❌ No unspent coins → Wallet has no XCH
- ❌ Insufficient balance → Need more XCH for fees (minimum ~0.000001 XCH)

#### 3. Configuration Issues
- ❌ Validation failed → Check required fields (name, description, URLs, hashes)
- ❌ Invalid hash format → Must be 64-character hex strings
- ❌ Invalid URLs → Must be valid HTTP/HTTPS URLs

#### 4. API Issues
- ❌ Network errors → Check internet connection
- ❌ 4xx/5xx responses → API endpoint issues
- ❌ Timeout errors → Network/server performance issues

### Step 4: API Endpoint Issues
If you see `🔧 Creating unsigned mint at endpoint:` failing, the issue is likely:
1. **Endpoint not available** - The API service is down
2. **Request format** - The request payload doesn't match expected format
3. **Authentication** - Missing or invalid JWT token

## Quick Test Script

Add this to test basic functionality:

```typescript
import { NFTMintDebugger } from './src/examples/NFTMintDebugger';

// In your app component
<NFTMintDebugger />
```

## Expected Success Flow

When working correctly, you should see:
```
✅ Config validation passed
🔑 Using synthetic public key flow for NFT minting  
🔧 Creating unsigned mint at endpoint: https://...
🔧 Unsigned mint result: {success: true, spend_bundle_hex: "...", coin_spends: [...]}
🖋️ Signing and broadcasting NFT mint spend bundle
📋 Mint API result: {success: true, data: {...}}
✅ Mint API succeeded: {transaction_id: "abc123..."}
🎉 NFT minted successfully!
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the debugger** to isolate exactly where the failure occurs
2. **Check browser console** for the detailed logging output  
3. **Verify wallet state** - ensure you have XCH balance and proper connection
4. **Test with minimal config** using the debug component first
5. **Check network** - ensure API endpoints are accessible

The enhanced logging will now show you exactly where in the minting pipeline the issue occurs, making it much easier to diagnose and fix the problem.
